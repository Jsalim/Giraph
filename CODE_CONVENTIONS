This codebase follows the Oracle "Code Conventions for the Java
Programming Language".  See the following link:

http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconvtoc-136057.html

In addition, this project has a couple of more specific rules:

* No tabs
* All indents should be 4 spaces (or 8 when there is confusion)
* All while/if/else must have brackets, even if there there is only a one
  line statement following.  'else' and 'else if' are expected to line up
  with the '}'.  For example:

if (condition) {
    statement;
}

if (condition) {
    statement;
} else {
    statement;
}

* Any use of LOG should be enclosed with an is*Enabled() method.  For example:

if (LOG.isInfoEnabled()) {
    LOG.info("something happened");
}

* Class members should not begin with 'm_' or '_'.
